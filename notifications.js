      'Find a beautiful piece of art...fall in love...admire it...and realize that that was created by human beings just like you, no more human, no less.',

      'When one has reached maturity...one will have a formless form. It is like ice dissolving into water. When one has no form, one can be all forms; when one has no style, he can fit in with any style.',

      'Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.',

      'You will do foolish things, but do them with enthusiasm.',

      'Don’t try to be original. Be simple. Be good technically, and if there is something in you, it will come out.',

      'We are all free, completely free. We can each do any damn thing we want. Which is more than most of us dare to imagine.',

      'However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there is life, there is hope.',

      'If there is any kind of magic in this world...it must be in the attempt of understanding someone, sharing something.',

      'You wanna fly, you got to give up the stuff that weighs you down.',

      'People with self-respect exhibit a certain toughness, a kind of moral nerve; they display what was once called character...character—the willingness to accept responsibility for their own own life.',

      'What you need to do is start living in the moment. You have to live moment to moment... You have got to learn how to smoke the cigarette, not act smoking the cigarette. You need to drink the drink, not act drinking the drink. You have to do things and not show them.'
